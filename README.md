# PIFD_shape_retrieval
This is a final project for the course: Mathematical Image Analysis. Lavinia and I implement a Phase-Inclusive Fourier Descriptor(PIFD) approach for shape retrieval.

The detailed methods for extracting PIFD come from this publshed paper: Emir Sokic, and Samim Konjicija. “Phase Preserving Fourier Descriptor for Shape-Based Image Retrieval.” Signal Processing. Image Communication, vol. 40, Elsevier BV, Jan. 2016, pp. 82–96, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2015.11.002.
