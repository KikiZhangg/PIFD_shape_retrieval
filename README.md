#  Phase-Inclusive Fourier Descriptor (PIFD) for Shape-based Image Retrieval
This is a final project for the course: Mathematical Image Analysis. Lavinia and I implemented a Phase-Inclusive Fourier Descriptor(PIFD) approach for shape-based image retrieval.

The detailed methods for extracting PIFD came from this published paper: Emir Sokic, and Samim Konjicija. “Phase Preserving Fourier Descriptor for Shape-Based Image Retrieval.” Signal Processing. Image Communication, vol. 40, Elsevier BV, Jan. 2016, pp. 82–96, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2015.11.002.

After developing our PIFD extraction algorithm, we further assessed its performance using machine learning to test on the MPEG-7 dataset. The evaluation involved a comparison between our PIFD approach, traditional magnitude-based Fourier descriptors, and simple image contours as inputs.
